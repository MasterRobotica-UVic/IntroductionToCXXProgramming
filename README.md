# Introduction to C++ programming

This is Session no. 2 of the brdige course before the master course.

You need to install CMake, make and compilers using `sudo apt-get install build-essential` to run the examples.

Each folder is a separate project with each own `CMakeLists.txt` file to ease the reading and understanding of each topic.

Slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11jX5ZQp-G80hwkG_sx-0D1028M3Bye_mmehOvehCoRQ/edit?usp=sharing).

Feel free to suggest any comment or issue any question.
