# Introduction to C++ programming

You need to install CMake, make and compilers using `sudo apt-get install build-essential` to run the examples.

Each folder is a separate project with each own `CMakeLists.txt` file to ease the reading and understanding of each topic.

Feel free to suggest any comment or issue any question or pull request for improvements.
